# React-Expense-Tracker
PURPOSE: Full stack Project that uses React.js to show a nice represenation of an expense tracker, and node.js to handle all the users expenses/income.

This a simple React Expense Tracker that allows you to add expenses or income into a nice interface. React.js is used to implment the interface of the front-end and Node.js is used to handle all the reuqests within the backend. I am using mongoDB as my database to store all the users data. Features within this app include adding and delting income/expenses and a nice represneation of your results in a pie graph. All of your income/expense are totaled in a final balance shown at the top. NOTE: The pie graph is not a true representation of the differene between income/expense. It just shows how income/expense can change the outcome of your results. Meaning more spending can result in red color = expense being more on the pie graph than green color = income. Future implmentation would be adding a user account so individuals can track their own expenses. You can find my website here https://obscure-escarpment-45773.herokuapp.com/.
